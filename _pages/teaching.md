### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I am the coordinator for the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/), in the [Natural Language Processing](https://idmc.univ-lorraine.fr/courses/master-degree-2-nlp/) (NLP) M2 program.

Course outline:
1. Introduction and Feedforward Neural Networks
2. Training Neural Networks
3. Advanced Training and Engineering
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Recurrent Neural Networks
6. Attention, Transformers, and Visualization
7. Generative Models

Resources: [lecture slides](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/694c3646bc574f95aa53/) and [practical notebooks](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/9403aa37e7a24e4882c0/).

I also teach practicals for the same course in the [Cognitive Sciences](https://idmc.univ-lorraine.fr/courses/master-2-sciences-cognitives/) M2 program.


### Automatic Speech Recognition

From 2021-2024, I used to teach practicals for the "Speech Recognition and Synthesis" course (M2 NLP program). The practical notebooks are available [here](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/a8dc604a544c4ee6b882/).
