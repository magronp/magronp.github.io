### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I am the coordinator for the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/), in the [Natural Language Processing](https://idmc.univ-lorraine.fr/courses/master-degree-2-nlp/) (NLP) M2 program.

Course outline:
- Introduction and Feedforward Neural Networks
- Training Neural Networks
- Advanced Training and Engineering
- Convolutional Networks
- Visualition and Recurrent Networks (1)
- Recurrent Networks (2) and Attention
- Generative Models

Resources: [lecture slides](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/694c3646bc574f95aa53/) and [practical notebooks](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/9403aa37e7a24e4882c0/).

I also teach practicals for the same course in the [Cognitive Sciences](https://idmc.univ-lorraine.fr/courses/master-2-sciences-cognitives/) M2 program.


### Automatic Speech Recognition

From 2021-2024, I used to teach practicals for the "Speech Recognition and Synthesis" course (M2 NLP program). The practical notebooks are available [here](https://mybox.inria.fr/d/a8dc604a544c4ee6b882/).
